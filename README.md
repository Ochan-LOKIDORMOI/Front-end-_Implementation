## Description of Dicover Rwanda App

This project aims to develop "Discover Rwanda," a comprehensive tourism app dedicated to showcasing the beauty of Rwanda, with a special focus on lesser-known parts of the country. Despite the presence of several tourism apps and websites, none focus exclusively on Rwanda, particularly its hidden gems that often go unnoticed. Our app will provide images, detailed information, and user reviews of these unique locations, promoting sustainable tourism and enhancing Rwanda's appeal as a travel destination. By fostering community engagement and economic opportunities, the app will improve the quality of life for locals and contribute to the local economy.
